Notes from Dave Scarlett link news letter
Leadership:
Confidence gives more opportunities to prove us. So have confidence a bit more than your skills to grow in your career.
Fake it until you make it but not too much. Know your limits. 
We should look at the results rather than the work we do. We should not keep in mind that I will get this result only if get this much work done. We should rather think what are in critical path to get results.
